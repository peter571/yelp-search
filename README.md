# Here’s a quick overview of how this react App should function:

- As a user, you should be able to search for restaurants
- As a user, you should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
- As a user, you should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter


# Tests the knowledge of: 

- JavaScript 
- React 
- API calls all with the goal of building a Yelp-like clone.

# IMPORTANT TO NOTE FOR THE APP TO WORK EFFECTIVELY

This Web App will currently not function correctly due to CORS restrictions.

We can bypass this restriction with an API called CORS Anywhere. CORS Anywhere will take requests sent to its API endpoint, make them for the requesting app with the proper CORS permissions, and then return the response back to the requesting app.

In your own browser, visit https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo and click “Request temporary access to the demo server” then you can try searching on the web app and see it functioning and retrieving data.
